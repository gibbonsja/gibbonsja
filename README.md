Hi, I’m @gibbonsja

I’m interested in array programming languages and their implementation. I am currently maintaining and working on the Nial
programming language.

I am also developing a variant of Nial based on a lisp/scheme syntax using the array theory primitives
of Nial as the basic operations.
